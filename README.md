# coauthor

This repo contains code to reproduce an analysis of coauthorship trends in biomedical research.

To reproduce the analysis, first obtain the preprocessed dataset `pmDat.RData` (from [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/](PubMed)), which will be made available at a data-sharing repository, and place it in a directory titled `calc` in the root directory. Then execute the scripts in the file `coauthor.r` (which may take a while).
